## EXTERNAL FIGURES

If you are including a figure from an external source, itâ€™s good practice to delineate this by applying the external class and adding a caption indicating where it is from. For example:

```{r fig.cap="Figure from https://example.com", out.extra="class=external"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/heatmap.png")


CROSSREFING FIGURES

```{r diamonds, fig.cap="Diamond Prices"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```

\@ref(fig:diamonds)

====================================================
FOOTNOTES
Footnotes use standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example ^[This will become a hover-able footnote]. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.This will become a hover-able footnote 1

ASIDE
You can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the <aside> tag.

<aside>
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.
</aside>

This content will appear in the gutter of the article.

FIGURES / ASIDE
You can also include figures in the gutter. Just enclose the code chunk which generates the figure in an <aside> tag:

<aside>
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
</aside>
